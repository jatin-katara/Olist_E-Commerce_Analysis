Olist E-Commerce Analysis Project
Module: analysis/export_powerbi_data.py

Objective:
    Extracts, transforms, and exports clean analytical datasets from the
    Olist SQLite database for use in the Power BI dashboard. Each exported
    dataset is designed to support business reporting, KPI tracking, customer
    segmentation, and interactive visualizations.

Key Operations:
    - Connect to SQLite database
    - Execute SQL queries to create analytics-ready datasets
    - Export cleaned fact and dimension tables as CSV files
    - Generate monthly aggregated revenue data
    - Preview exported datasets for validation
    - Prepare a star-schema-friendly data model for Power BI

Database Source:
    olist_ecommerce.db (Project Root)

Outputs:
    - exports/powerbi/fact_orders_clean.csv
    - exports/powerbi/dim_customers_rfm.csv
    - exports/powerbi/agg_monthly_revenue.csv
